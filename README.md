# Lunar dark mode swich

This is a dark-mode toggle which shows the real phase of the moon, and the current earth daylight position

Built with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/). It was a great opportunity to test drive the new ECMAScript `Temporal` [proposal](https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/docs/index.html). Using [Twemoji](https://github.com/twitter/twemoji) instead of emoji glyphs, because they are horribly inconsistent in size across different unicode implementations.
